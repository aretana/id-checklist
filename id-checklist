1. Introduction

All Internet Drafts (I-Ds) that are offered to an Area Director (AD) or the
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) with a request for publication as
an RFC must conform to the following requirements or they will be returned
to the author(s) or editor(s) for revision.

The Working Group (WG) Chairs are responsible for having this list checked
before submission to an Area Director to begin the review and publication
process.

A handy tool (awk script) to check most of the formatting nits (as in 
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 below) is available at 
http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/, courtesy of Henrik Levkowetz.

Another set of handy tools is available at the IETF TOOLS pages, which
can be found at https://tools.ietf.org/.

Checking for content related issues (as in Sections 2.3, 3, and 4 below) 
needs a human eye.  

All content issues have to be checked early in the development of documents, 
being technically integral. The WG Chairs are responsible for this too.
The ADs will not accept the document and so will not put it on the IESG 
agenda if this check has not been done.

Responsibility for all checking is with the authors in the case of an 
individual submission.

This document only talks about "finished" Internet-Drafts, that is, those I-Ds 
for which the IESG gets a request for publication.  However, it is strongly 
recommended to follow these guidelines for documents that go to WG Last 
Call as well.

Guidelines for all Internet-Drafts are in Guidelines to Authors of 
Internet-Drafts, and are not repeated here.

As a suggestion for productivity improvement, it is strongly recommended to 
use XML2RFC v3 [RFC 7991] (Hoffman, P., “The xml2rfc Version 3 Vocabulary,”
December 2016) as source files for generating an Internet-Draft.  There is
even an online xml2rfc tool to generate the Internet-Draft .txt files.
That tool automatically takes care of most of the formatting, administrative 
and bureaucratic rules.

2. Form Nits

2.1.  Formatting

In principle, the RFC Editor can take care of a few small formatting errors. 
And, if there are only a few, then they will do so.  However, if many errors 
exist, the document will be returned to the author(s), editor(s), or the
WG for fixes.  In any event, please realize that not following the formatting
rules will most probably delay publication and does consume time that can be spend on other work.

See the RFC Style Guide [RFC 7322] (Flanagan, H., and Ginoza, S., "RFC Style
Guide", September 2014) for further rules.  A checklist of formatting problems
rules that often get neglected is provided here:

* No text beyond the 72nd column of a line. This is especially important 
  for diagrams and code, which the RFC Editor may not be able to trivially 
  reformat to fall within the margins.

* Must be ragged right

* No hyphenation for line breaks. However, hyphenated words (e.g., 
  "Internet-Draft") may be split at the hyphen across successive lines.

* No footnotes

* ASCII-only; no control characters (other than CR, NL and FF).
  [MSK: Is this still true?]

* Do not number the "Status of Memo" or "Abstract" sections

* Do not add a numbered reference in the I-D boilerplate to RFC 5378 or RFC 
  5379 (or to RFC 2026, RFC 3667, RFC 3668, RFC 3978, or RFC 3979 for older
  documents). If you do, it makes it harder for the RFC Editor to process the
  document when they strip off the I-D boilerplate.

* Reasonably well formatted for readibility and clarity

2.2.  Required Sections - All I-Ds

The following are REQUIRED sections in all Internet-Drafts:

* Internet Draft boilerplate

  * It must not contain boilerplate that prohibits publication as an RFC; see 
    [RFC 5378] (Bradner, S., Contreras, J., “Rights Contributors Provide to the
    IETF Trust,” November 2008), Section 3.3.

  * List of authors/editors; there should not be more than five authors or
    editors (see http://www.rfc-editor.org/policy.html)

  * Abstract

  * Table of Contents, required if document is more than 15 pages

  * Introduction

  * Security Considerations; see [RFC 3552] (Rescorla, E., Korver, B., and
    Internet Architecture Board, "Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security
    Considerations," July 2003).

  * IANA Considerations
    A. Must specify if IANA has to create a new registry or modify rules for 
    an existing registry.

    B. Must specify if the document requires IANA to assign or update values 
    in an IANA registry before RFC publication.

    C. See "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" 
    [RFC 8126] (Cotton, M., Leiba, B., and Narten, T., “Guidelines for Writing
    an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,” June 2017).

    D. Certain other situations might find the following additional citations
    to be useful:

    * [RFC 2780] (Bradner, S. and V. Paxson, “IANA Allocation Guidelines For
      Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers,” March 2000.)

    * [RFC 5237] (Arkko, J. and S. Bradner, “IANA Allocation Guidelines for the
    Protocol Field,” February 2008.)

    * [RFC 3692] (Narten, T., “Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers
      Considered Useful,” January 2004.)

    E. If there is no action for IANA, the section should say that, e.g., 
    including something like "This document has no actions for IANA."
    The RFC Editor will remove such a section prior to publication.

  * References, which must be split into normative and informative sections
    (see http://www.rfc-editor.org/policy.html).

  * Author's Address

  * IPR Disclosure, verbatim from [RFC 3978] (Bradner, S., “IETF Rights in 
    Contributions,” March 2005.) section 5.1.
    [MSK: Is this correct?  I've never seen this in a document, but rather
    as part of shepherd writeups.  But maybe this is only for documents
    that actually have an IPR declaration and I've just never seen one.
    In that case, we should make that clear here.]

  * IPR Notice, verbatim from [RFC 3979] (Bradner, S., “Intellectual Property 
    Rights in IETF Technology,” March 2005.) section 5. If these notices are
    not present, then the RFC-Editor will add them (as per RFC 3979 section 5),
    but it will speed up the process if the notices are already present in the 
    Internet-Draft.
    [MSK: Same.]

  * Copyright Notice and Disclaimer, as is present in the current Legend
    Instructions.  For further details, see [RFC 5378] (Bradner, S., and
    Contreras, J., “Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust", November
    2008), Section 6.

3. Content Issues

This section describes content issues that are common to many documents,
non-adherence to which will degrade the quality of the document and result
in further iteration and work needed.  Authors, editors, document shepherds,
and working group chairs are advised to observe these before submitting
a document for publication.

3.1. Abstract

* See Section 4.3 in the RFC Style Guide (cited above).

* Should be meaningful to someone not versed in the technology; most 
  abbreviations must be expanded on first use.

* No citations should be present.

* If your document obsoletes or updates a previous RFC, then the Abstract
  should say so explicitly.

        Add the "Updates:" and "Obsoletes:" lines on the frontpage. Here is 
        an example of what the frontpage should look like:

           Network Working Group                                <yourname>
           Internet-Draft                               <your affiliation>
           Obsoletes: xxxx (if approved)                   August 29, 2006
           Updates: yyyy, zzzz (if approved)
           Intended status: Best Current Practice
           Expires: February 21, 2007

           ...

           Abstract

           This document describes .....

           It obsoletes RFC xxxx and updates RFC yyyy and RFC zzzz

3.2.  Updating or Obsoleting Existing Documents

If your document updates or obsoletes (replaces) an existing document,
it is expected that the following will be present in your document:

* A sentence in the Abstract that says so (see above).
  [MSK: Do we still really need this?]

* A more complete explanation in the Introduction of how and why this
  document updates or obsoletes the earlier document.

* A section, usually near the end, that summarizes the changes from the
  document that is being updated or obsoleted.

* If your new document addresses any errata registered against the older
  document, those should be identified in the summary of changes section.

3.3.  Security Considerations section

As cited above, [RFC 3552] provides current best guidance about writing
a Security Considerations section.  This section is mandatory in all
documents.

The text of this section must have a meaningful exploration of security issues
raised by the proposal, which should include both risks and description of
solutions or workarounds.  It is rare that technical work can legitimately
make a claim like "This protocol introduces no security considerations,"
so it needs to be fairly obvious for that to be believable, or the document
will be returned for further development.

If applicable, you may also find help in [RFC 5406] (Bellovin, S., “Guidelines
for Specifying the Use of IPsec Version 2,” February 2009).

It is also important to use the proper terminology for security terms, as 
defined in [RFC 4949] (Shirey, R., “Internet Security Glossary, Version 2,” 
August 2007).

For MIB documents, [RFC4181] (Heard, C., "Guidelines for Authors and
Reviewers of MIB Documents", September 2005) should be used as a starting
point.

3.4.  Normative Language

If capitalized MUST, SHOULD, etc., is used, then it is expected that BCP 14's
boilerplate will be included in an appropriate definitions section, and cited
as a normative reference.  BCP 14 is made up of [RFC 2119] (Bradner, S.,
“Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,” March 1997) and
[RFC 8174] (Leiba, B., "Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key
Words", May 2017).

Also, authors need to use this langauge in accordance with the guidelines
specified in RFC 2119.

3.5.  IPR Statements

Specific Intellectual Property Rights (IPR, e.g., patent claims and terms)
must not be in an RFC (or Internet-Draft).  Any claims must be submitted via
the IETF IPR web page as notice that there is some IPR claim.  The mandatory
IPR Notice from [RFC 8179] (Bradner, S., and Contreras, J., “Intellectual
Property Rights in IETF Technology,” May 2017) points readers to the IETF
IPR web page.

3.6.  Formal Languages

Use of formal languages should be in conformance with the IESG statement 
on the use of formal languages; see:

    IESG Statement: Guidelines for the Use of Formal Languages in IETF 
    Specifications

...at:

    https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/formal-languages-use/

In particular:

A. All MIB modules should have correct syntax, so they should compile cleanly 
using:

          smilint -m -s -l 6 -i namelength-32

An online WEB service is available for syntax checking at:  
http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/libsmi/tools/.

This allows you to extract the MIB module from a document for your own local 
use, but you can also directly run a syntax check. You can also download the 
libsmi tools for local use.

In most cases there should be no errors or warnings present in the report. 
Please evaluate all diagnostic messages before assuming that they are OK. If 
in doubt, feel free to check on the ietfmibs@ietf.org mailing list or with 
the OPS ADs.

B. Besides the syntax checking, a MIB document should also be checked against 
the [RFC 4181] and [RFC 4841] (Heard, C., “RFC 4181 Update to Recognize the
IETF Trust,” March 2007).

C. All ABNF must be checked.  A tool is available at http://www.apps.ietf.org.
See [RFC 5234] (Crocker, D. and P. Overell, “Augmented BNF for Syntax 
Specifications: ABNF,” January 2008) for information about IETF ABNF.  If 
ABNF is used, you must include a normative reference to RFC 5234.

D. Protocol specifications that use XML should always use well-formed XML at 
a minimum. Sample XML instances included in a specification have to be 
well-formed, and if the XML is supposed to be valid (according to the current 
W3C definition of validity), the samples must reference and be validated 
using an appropriate XML Schema, DTD, or other standard validation mechanism 
that is structurally and syntactically correct. Links to tools to check XML 
validity, including a schema checker and a validating parser, can be found at 
http://www.apps.ietf.org.  Other guidelines for the use of XML in IETF
protocols can be found in BCP 70 [RFC 3470] (Hollenbeck, S., Rose, M.,
and L. Masinter, “Guidelines for the Use of Extensible Markup Language (XML)
within IETF Protocols,” January 2003).

E. XML provides structures, such as the "<any>" element information item in XML 
Schema, to allow element extensions. If these structures are included in a 
protocol, the protocol specification must include clear guidance on how, 
when, and where the extension structures, such as versioning, can be used.

F. XML Schemas, Namespaces, and Resource Description Framework (RDF) Schemas 
should be registered with the IANA using the procedures described in BCP 81 
[RFC 3688] (Mealling, M., “The IETF XML Registry,” January 2004).

3.7.  Example Addresses

Addresses used in examples should use fully qualified domain names instead 
of literal IP addresses, and should use example FQDNs such as 
"foo.example.com" instead of real-world FQDNs.  See [RFC 2606] (Eastlake, D. 
and A. Panitz, “Reserved Top Level DNS Names,” June 1999) for example domain 
names that can be used.

There are also ranges of IP addresses set aside for this purpose.  For IPv4,
these are defined in [RFC 3330] (IANA, “Special-Use IPv4 Addresses,”
September 2002); for IPv6, see [RFC 3849] (Huston, G., Lord, A., 
and P. Smith, “IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation,” July 2004).

Private addresses that would be used in the real world are to be avoided in 
examples.

Similarly, real telephone numbers should not be used.  Instead use those 
numbers that were reserved for examples or fictitious use . Available numbers 
for use in examples are:

* UK: +44-<geographic-area-code>-496-<0000-0999> (see 
http://www.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/ioi/numbers/num_drama)

* USA: +1-<area code>-555-<0100-0199> (see 
http://www.nanpa.com/nas/public/form555MasterReport.do?method=display555MasterReport)
[MSK: This URL seems to be dead.]

3.8.  References

All references must be stable and resolvable.

A bare HTTP URL is not generally considered a stable reference.  For 
Web-only documents, adding a reference number, title and/or an author will 
help make the reference more stable.
[MSK: I think this is no longer strictly true.  Are there guidelines that
are more current?]

Judgment can be used here; the stability of normative references is even 
more important than the stability of informative references.

In case of references to Internet-Drafts, use the format: author, "title" 
(I-D file name).

Normative references to I-Ds will cause a standards-track or BCP document to 
wait in the RFC-Editor queue (see RFC-Editor queue) for the referenced I-Ds 
to be published as RFCs.

Normative and informative references to non-IETF documents are permitted. 
However, it is best to minimize such normative references, because assessing 
their status when the IETF document advances on the standards-track is very 
difficult. It is important to use the exact title, author name(s), 
organization and publication date.

3.9.  Stale Text

Avoid text that will become outdated after RFC is published.  Examples include
non-permanent URLs, mentions of specific mailing lists as places to send
comments on a document, or referring to specific WGs as a place to perform
specific future actions (e.g., reviewing followup documents). In some cases
(like the ORGANIZATION clause in MIB modules), references to working groups
are impossible to avoid; however, generally, Internet-Drafts should not assign
powers or responsibilities to WGs unless the WG in question will exist as long
as the practice documented in the published RFC remains valid. In cases where
a specific WG is expected to be a focal point for future action, it is
acceptable to give the task to the IESG, giving instructions on how the action
is expected to be delegated, e.g., by forwarding to an appropriate WG or other
set of experts.

4. Protocol Issues

This section provides some general guidance that will help to avoid extended
discussion during the document review and approval process:

Avoid IPv4 specificity. Both IPv4 and IPv6 must be supportable, unless 
the protocol is naturally IPv4 specific or IPv6 specific.

No application can be permitted to cause catastrophic congestion.  See 
[RFC 2914] (Floyd, S., “Congestion Control Principles,” September 2000) for 
details.  Applications using TCP or SCTP will normally fulfill this
requirement automatically.

If any sort of end-to-end checksum or integrity check is being used 
(especially, but not limited to, cryptographic checksums or MACs), specify 
precisely the contents of the fields to be checksummed, and in exactly what 
order the operations are done. Pay special attention to any area reserved 
for the checksum itself.

All user-visible text fields must be internationalizable.  See [RFC 2277] 
(Alvestrand, H., “IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages,” January 
1998). For most cases, this means UTF-8 [RFC 3629] (Yergeau, F., “UTF-8, a 
transformation format of ISO 10646,” November 2003).

If text fields are included in some calculation, like matching, sorting,
etc., it must be described in detail how those operations are applied to the 
Unicode/ISO 10646 character set. See "stringprep" [RFC 8264] (Saint-Andre, P.
and M. Blanchet, “PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison
of Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols", December 2017)
for more information on the recommended way of handling comparisons.
